    from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking

    the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,
    it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before 
    us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going

    in the superlative degree of comparison only.

    both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and 
    fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.
    It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations
    were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained
    her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had
    heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing
    up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of 
    years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality)
    rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, 
    from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the
    human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.`;

let modestProposal = `It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this
    great town, or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads, and
    cabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three, four, 
    or six children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for an alms. These
    mothers, instead of being able to work for their honest livelihood, are forced 
    to employ all their time in stroling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants
    who, as they grow up, either turn thieves for want of work, or leave their dear
    native country, to fight for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.
    I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of children in the arms,
    or on the backs, or at the heels of their mothers, and frequently of their fathers,
    is in the present deplorable state of the kingdom, a very great additional
    grievance; and therefore whoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of
    making these children sound and useful members of the commonwealth, would deserve so 
    well of the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of the nation.
    But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the children
    of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and shall take in the whole
    number of infants at a certain age, who are born of parents in effect as little
    able to support them, as those who demand our charity in the streets.
    As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years upon this important 
    subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of our projectors, I have
    always found them grossly mistaken in their computation. It is true, a child just 
    dropt from its dam, may be supported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other 
    nourishment: at most not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may certainly 
    get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of begging; and it is exactly at one 
    year old that I propose to provide for them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge 
    upon their parents, or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their lives, 
    they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to the 
    clothing of many thousands.`;

let greatGatsby = `In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some
    advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.
    “Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember that all 
    the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”
    He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, 
    and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined 
    to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also 
    made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach 
    itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college 
    I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, 
    unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, 
    or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; 
    for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express 
    them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements 
    is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget 
    that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental 
    decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.
    And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. 
    Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I 
    don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I 
    wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no 
    more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the 
    man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented 
    everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of 
    successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity 
    to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register 
    earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby 
    impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an 
    extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other 
    person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at 
    the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that 
    emporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.`;

    The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in a glass.
    The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing 
    his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter 
    of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect 
    medium. No artist desires to prove anything. Even things that are true can be proved. 
    No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable 
    mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express everything. Thought 
    and language are to the artist instruments of an art. Vice and virtue are to the artist 
    materials for an art. From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the 
    art of the musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the type. 
    All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their 
    peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, 
    that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is 
    new, complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with himself. 
    We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only 
    excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.
    All art is quite useless.`;

let adventuresOfSherlockHolmes = `To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. 
    I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she 
    eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any 
    emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, 
    were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I 
    take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has 
    seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He 
    never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were 
    admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s 
    motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions 
    into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a 
    distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. 
    Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, 
    would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And 
    yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, 
    of dubious and questionable memory.
    I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each 
    other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise 
    up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, 
    were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every 
    form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in 
    Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week 
    between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce 
    energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by 
    the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary 
    powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those 
    mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From 
    time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to 
    Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular 
    tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission 
    which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning 
    family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I 
    merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of 
    my former friend and companion.
    One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a 
    journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way 
    led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must 
    always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents 
    f the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, 
    and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were 
    brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure 
    pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room 
    swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped 
    behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner 
    told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his 
    drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. 
    I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly 
    been in part my own.`;

let theWorldOfTheWorlds = `No one would have believed in the last years of the 
nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences 
greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about 
their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly 
as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and 
multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this 
globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter. 
It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a 
thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of 
them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. 
It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At 
most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior 
to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of 
space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, 
intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, 
and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth 
century came the great disillusionment.
The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the sun at a 
mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it receives from the 
sun is barely half of that received by this world. It must be, if the nebular 
hypothesis has any truth, older than our world; and long before this earth ceased 
to be molten, life upon its surface must have begun its course. The fact that it 
is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its 
cooling to the temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and 
all that is necessary for the support of animated existence.
Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to the 
very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that intelligent life 
might have developed there far, or indeed at all, beyond its earthly level. Nor 
was it generally understood that since Mars is older than our earth, with 
scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily 
follows that it is not only more distant from time’s beginning but nearer its end.
The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already gone far 
indeed with our neighbour. Its physical condition is still largely a mystery, 
but we know now that even in its equatorial region the midday temperature barely 
approaches that of our coldest winter. Its air is much more attenuated than ours, 
its oceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow 
seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically 
inundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which to us is still 
incredibly remote, has become a present-day problem for the inhabitants of Mars. 
The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects, enlarged their 
powers, and hardened their hearts. And looking across space with instruments, and 
intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance 
only 35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope, our own warmer planet, 
green with vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility, 
with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and 
narrow, navy-crowded seas.`;

let candide = `In a castle of Westphalia, belonging to the Baron of Thunder-ten-Tronckh, 
    lived a youth, whom nature had endowed with the most gentle manners. His countenance 
    was a true picture of his soul. He combined a true judgment with simplicity of 
    spirit, which was the reason, I apprehend, of his being called Candide. The old 
    servants of the family suspected him to have been the son of the Baron's sister, 
    by a good, honest gentleman of the neighborhood, whom that young lady would never 
    marry because he had been able to prove only seventy-one quarterings, the rest of 
    his genealogical tree having been lost through the injuries of time.
    The Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia, for his castle had 
    not only a gate, but windows. His great hall, even, was hung with tapestry. 
    All the dogs of his farm-yards formed a pack of hounds at need; his grooms were 
    his huntsmen; and the curate of the village was his grand almoner. They called 
    him "My Lord," and laughed at all his stories.
    The Baron's lady weighed about three hundred and fifty pounds, and was therefore 
    a person of great consideration, and she did the honours of the house with a dignity 
    that commanded still greater respect. Her daughter Cunegonde was seventeen years of 
    age, fresh-coloured, comely, plump, and desirable. The Baron's son seemed to be in every 
    respect worthy of his father. The Preceptor Pangloss was the oracle of the family, 
    and little Candide heard his lessons with all the good faith of his age and character.
    Pangloss was professor of metaphysico-theologico-cosmolo-nigology. He proved 
    admirably that there is no effect without a cause, and that, in this best of all 
    possible worlds, the Baron's castle was the most magnificent of castles, and his 
    lady the best of all possible Baronesses.
    "It is demonstrable," said he, "that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; 
    for all being created for an end, all is necessarily for the best end. Observe, 
    that the nose has been formed to bear spectacles—thus we have spectacles. Legs are 
    visibly designed for stockings and we have stockings. Stones were made to be hewn, and 
    to construct castles—therefore my lord has a magnificent castle; for the greatest 
    baron in the province ought to be the best lodged. Pigs were made to be eaten—therefore 
    we eat pork all the year round. Consequently they who assert that all is well have said 
    a foolish thing, they should have said all is for the best."
    Candide listened attentively and believed innocently; for he thought Miss Cunegonde 
    extremely beautiful, though he never had the courage to tell her so. He concluded that 
    after the happiness of being born of Baron of Thunder-ten-Tronckh, the second degree 
    of happiness was to be Miss Cunegonde, the third that of seeing her every day, and 
    the fourth that of hearing Master Pangloss, the greatest philosopher of the whole 
    province, and consequently of the whole world.
    One day Cunegonde, while walking near the castle, in a little wood which they called 
    a park, saw between the bushes, Dr. Pangloss giving a lesson in experimental natural 
    philosophy to her mother's chamber-maid, a little brown wench, very pretty and very 
    docile. As Miss Cunegonde had a great disposition for the sciences, she breathlessly 
    observed the repeated experiments of which she was a witness; she clearly perceived 
    the force of the Doctor's reasons, the effects, and the causes; she turned back greatly 
    flurried, quite pensive, and filled with the desire to be learned; dreaming that she 
    might well be a sufficient reason for young Candide, and he for her.
    She met Candide on reaching the castle and blushed; Candide blushed also; she 
    wished him good morrow in a faltering tone, and Candide spoke to her without 
    knowing what he said. The next day after dinner, as they went from table, 
    Cunegonde and Candide found themselves behind a screen; Cunegonde let fall her 
    handkerchief, Candide picked it up, she took him innocently by the hand, the youth as 
    innocently kissed the young lady's hand with particular vivacity, sensibility, and 
    grace; their lips met, their eyes sparkled, their knees trembled, their hands strayed. 
    Baron Thunder-ten-Tronckh passed near the screen and beholding this cause and effect 
    chased Candide from the castle with great kicks on the backside; Cunegonde fainted 
    away; she was boxed on the ears by the Baroness, as soon as she came to herself; 
    and all was consternation in this most magnificent and most agreeable of all possible castles.`;

let callOfTheWild = `Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble
    was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of muscle and 
    with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego. Because men, groping in the Arctic 
    darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies 
    were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland. These men 
    wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which 
    to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.
    Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller’s place, 
    it was called. It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which 
    glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides. The 
    house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading 
    lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars. At the rear things were on 
    even a more spacious scale than at the front. There were great stables, where a dozen 
    grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants’ cottages, an endless and orderly 
    array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches. 
    Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where 
    Judge Miller’s boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.
    And over this great demesne Buck ruled. Here he was born, and here he had lived the 
    four years of his life. It was true, there were other dogs, There could not but be 
    other dogs on so vast a place, but they did not count. They came and went, resided 
    in the populous kennels, or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the 
    fashion of Toots, the Japanese pug, or Ysabel, the Mexican hairless,—strange 
    creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground. On the other 
    hand, there were the fox terriers, a score of them at least, who yelped fearful 
    promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by 
    a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops.
    But Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his. He plunged 
    into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge’s sons; he escorted Mollie and 
    Alice, the Judge’s daughters, on long twilight or early morning rambles; on wintry 
    nights he lay at the Judge’s feet before the roaring library fire; he carried the 
    Judge’s grandsons on his back, or rolled them in the grass, and guarded their footsteps 
    through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard, and even beyond, where 
    the paddocks were, and the berry patches. Among the terriers he stalked imperiously, 
    and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored, for he was king,—king over all creeping, 
    crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included.`;

let wizardOfOz = `Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with 
Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife. Their 
house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many 
miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and 
this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, 
a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had 
a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. 
There was no garret at all, and no cellar—except a small hole dug in 
the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case 
one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to crush any building 
in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, 
from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.
When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing 
but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke 
the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in 
all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with 
little cracks running through it. Even the grass was not green, for the 
sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray 
color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun 
blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and now the house was 
as dull and gray as everything else.
When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun 
and wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes 
and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and 
lips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled 
now. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been 
so startled by the child’s laughter that she would scream and press her 
hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy’s merry voice reached her ears; 
and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could 
find anything to laugh at.
Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night 
and did not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard 
to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.
It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray 
as her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, 
with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on 
either side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and 
Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.
Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep 
and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual. Dorothy 
stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too. 
Aunt Em was washing the dishes.`;
